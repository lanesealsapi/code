<h1>Emergent Behavioral Dynamics of a Neural Goldfish in a Virtual Aquatic Environment</h1>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>This study investigates the emergent behavior of a simulated goldfish endowed with a minimalist neural network, interacting with dynamically responsive food particles and jellyfish within a controlled digital environment. By integrating core reinforcement principles, velocity constraints, and stochastic motion, the model demonstrates adaptive foraging, predator avoidance, and naturalistic locomotion, providing insights into bio-inspired computational agent design.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Animal locomotion and foraging behavior have long served as paradigms for understanding decision-making in both biological and artificial systems. Goldfish (<em>Carassius auratus</em>), in particular, exhibit continuous exploratory behavior, environmental responsiveness, and social interactions that make them ideal candidates for computational modeling. The present work constructs a virtual goldfish agent equipped with a neural network, designed to simulate these behaviors in a fully interactive aquatic environment. The simulation aims to explore how minimal neural architectures, combined with simple sensory inputs and physical constraints, can give rise to lifelike emergent behavior.</p>

<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>The goldfish agent receives sensory inputs corresponding to relative positions of nearby food and jellyfish. A compact feedforward neural network with a single hidden layer maps these inputs to acceleration vectors, modulating the agent’s motion. To ensure continuous locomotion, a hard-coded minimum velocity constraint is enforced. Stochastic perturbations emulate water turbulence, introducing variability to the swim trajectory. Food particles employ basic avoidance behavior scaled to the agent’s velocity, while jellyfish exhibit reactive movement to maintain spatial separation from the agent, thereby creating a naturalistic interaction dynamic. Energy levels modulate hunger-driven acceleration, inducing the agent to prioritize foraging when resources are scarce.</p>

<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Simulations reveal the goldfish exhibits non-linear, emergent behaviors, including targeted foraging, avoidance of jellyfish, and adaptive acceleration patterns. The neural network successfully integrates multiple inputs, producing behavior that balances risk and reward while maintaining continuous motion. Randomized turbulence prevents deterministic trajectories, enhancing the perceptual realism of movement. Food and jellyfish responses, scaled relative to the agent’s velocity, contribute to a coherent ecosystem-like dynamic, wherein each entity’s motion appears naturally interdependent.</p>

<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>The integration of neural decision-making with simple physical constraints yields a model demonstrating emergent adaptive behavior without complex rule sets. The goldfish’s continuous motion and reactive acceleration reflect real-world biological principles of energy optimization and environmental interaction. Moreover, the inclusion of stochastic turbulence enhances unpredictability, illustrating how minimal neural and environmental modeling can simulate lifelike locomotion patterns. The relative speed scaling of food and jellyfish ensures ecological consistency, further validating the simulation’s behavioral fidelity.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>This work highlights the capacity of compact neural networks combined with simple behavioral rules to produce emergent, lifelike behaviors in a virtual agent. By modeling hunger-driven foraging, predator avoidance, and stochastic motion, the goldfish demonstrates adaptive decision-making within a dynamic environment. The results suggest potential applications in bio-inspired robotics, artificial life simulations, and computational ethology, where minimal architectures can yield complex behavioral patterns. Future work may explore reinforcement-based learning, multi-agent interactions, and dynamic environment adaptation to further enhance behavioral realism.</p>
