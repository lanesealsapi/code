This paper introduces TOG, a new toggle-oriented programming language that makes programming simpler by using ON/OFF states instead of long and complex syntax. Unlike most languages that use many words and structures, TOG reduces everything to toggles. This makes it easier to learn, faster to prototype, and fun for creative coding. This paper explains how TOG works, shows examples, and argues why this approach is valuable.
1. Introduction
Most programming languages use complicated rules and words like if/else, while, or function. TOG asks a simpler question: what if programming was just about flipping states ON and OFF? This approach makes coding more direct, more intuitive, and easier to learn. TOG is designed to combine simplicity with expressive power.
2. Syntax of TOG
TOG uses a small set of symbols instead of long keywords:
- `?` = condition (if)
- `->` = then
- `<>` = else
- `~` = loop until OFF
- `!` = toggle the state of a variable
Example Program
Here is a short program written in TOG:
#engine = ON
engine = OFF
? engine -> print("running") <> print("stopped")
engine!
? engine -> print("running") <> print("stopped")
3. Toggle Semantics
In TOG, variables are always in one of two states: ON or OFF. The toggle operator `!` flips the state. This makes TOG closer to real-world switches, circuits, and systems where states matter. For example:
light = OFF
light!
? light -> print("The light is ON") <> print("The light is OFF")
4. Use Cases
1. Teaching: TOG helps beginners understand programming logic faster.
2. Prototyping: Developers can write ideas quickly without worrying about complex syntax.
3. Art and Creative Code: TOG‚Äôs minimal style makes it great for experiments and generative art.
5. Conclusion
TOG reduces programming to the simple act of flipping states. This minimal design makes it powerful for teaching, prototyping, and creativity. By recognizing the power of toggles, L.A.x. (ur'c) has introduced a new way to think about coding: not through long rules, but through the elegance of ON and OFF.

The Language of Tog: A Master‚Äôs-Level Exploration
Introduction: Why TOG Matters
Every generation of programmers invents a new way to talk to machines. Some are vast and industrial, like Java or C++, while others are poetic, like Python or Ruby. TOG was not born in a corporate boardroom, nor in a strict academic lab. It was born from curiosity, play, and the question: what if a programming language could be simpler, lighter, and still expressive?
At its heart, TOG is about flipping states. It thrives on toggles, switches, on/off rhythms that reflect the binary pulse of computers themselves. But TOG isn‚Äôt just about being minimal ‚Äî it‚Äôs about being human-readable, fun, and a little rebellious against the heavy machinery of mainstream languages.
The ethos of TOG is clarity, simplicity, and flow. You don‚Äôt need endless punctuation or boilerplate to express intent. You need toggles. You need rhythm. You need code that feels alive when you read it.
This paper explores TOG‚Äôs philosophy, syntax, and practical design. It offers examples of arrays, functions, conditionals, and even speculative uses like spreadsheets and crypto coins. Along the way, we‚Äôll keep the tone friendly and engaging, with the occasional joke ‚Äî because code without humor is just paperwork.
The Ethos of Tog
TOG lives by three principles:
Minimalism: Every piece of syntax should be simple and memorable. TOG avoids overloading developers with curly braces, semicolons, or boilerplate.
Playfulness: TOG embraces fun. A toggle can be a cat face üê±, a glowing ring, or a literal word ‚Äúflip.‚Äù This sense of play makes code feel less like labor and more like art.
Flow: TOG reads like plain thought. It avoids heavy ceremony and instead mimics natural language. Keywords like if, then, and func feel close to the way people already think about problems.
These principles may sound lighthearted, but they carry serious implications. A language that prioritizes minimalism and play is one that can teach beginners, empower hobbyists, and still intrigue experts who want to escape complexity.
Core Syntax of TOG
The best way to understand TOG is to see it in action.
Variables
dog = 1
cat = 2
Variables in TOG are straightforward. No type declarations, no ceremony. Just assignment.
Arrays
animals = ["dog", "cat", "panda"]
Arrays are flexible. They store lists of values, just like Python or JavaScript. But TOG doesn‚Äôt complicate things with strong typing.
Conditionals
TOG introduces natural language-style conditionals.
?dog == 1 then cat()
This means: If dog equals 1, then call cat().
The ? signals a condition, and then acts like a direct flow arrow.
You can also add an alternative:
?dog == 1 then cat() else bark()
Readable. Playful. Minimal.
Functions
TOG functions use the func keyword. There are two common wrappers: () and {}.
func greet() (
  print("Hello from TOG")
)

func laugh() {
  print("üòÇüòÇüòÇ")
}
Both are valid. It depends on the coder‚Äôs taste.
Calling them is equally simple:
greet()
laugh()
TOG Arrays in Depth
Arrays are TOG‚Äôs bread and butter. They give structure to toggles and open the door to spreadsheets, coins, and more.
Consider a spreadsheet built in TOG:
sheet = [
  ["Name", "Age", "City"],
  ["Lance", 34, "Seattle"],
  ["Mira", 29, "Denver"]
]
Accessing data is natural:
print(sheet[1][0])   # Lance
Appending rows and columns follows toggle-style flow:
sheet << ["Kai", 22, "Tokyo"]   # Add row
TOG arrays keep things approachable, but flexible enough to grow into more complex data structures.
Project TOG: Crypto Coin
One of the more playful but serious applications of TOG is imagining a crypto coin. Why? Because coins are just arrays of transactions.
coin = []

func mint(amount, to) (
  tx = ["mint", amount, to]
  coin << tx
)

func transfer(from, to, amount) (
  tx = ["transfer", from, to, amount]
  coin << tx
)
Here, coin is just a ledger (an array). Each transaction is appended. This isn‚Äôt a full blockchain, but it illustrates how TOG can handle abstract financial logic with simplicity.
The ethos is again clear: arrays are everything, and toggles are states of trust.
Tog as Spreadsheet
We can also use TOG as a mini spreadsheet engine.
func getCell(r, c) (
  return sheet[r][c]
)

func setCell(r, c, val) (
  sheet[r][c] = val
)
This is minimal code that lets you treat arrays like Excel cells. With SUM and AVG functions, TOG can feel like a lightweight formula engine.
func SUM(arr) (
  total = 0
  i = 0
  ~ (i < #arr) (
    total += arr[i]
    i++
  )
  return total
)
Jokes practically write themselves here: Why did the spreadsheet go to therapy? Too many unresolved cells.
Humor in TOG
Humor isn‚Äôt just garnish ‚Äî it‚Äôs part of the design. TOG embraces jokes and metaphors as teaching tools. Consider:
potato = "ü•î"
?potato == "ü•î" then print("Better run!")
This is more than a joke. It‚Äôs a reminder that programming doesn‚Äôt have to be sterile. The playful ethos of TOG helps beginners laugh while learning, and helps experts feel free again.
Why TOG is Great
So why is TOG great?
It‚Äôs approachable: TOG avoids scary syntax. If you know how to type if ... then, you can already program.
It‚Äôs flexible: Arrays and toggles can model spreadsheets, coins, games, or just silly cat faces.
It‚Äôs fast to learn: Minimal rules mean you can grasp TOG in a single afternoon.
It‚Äôs fun: Humor, emojis, and toggles make coding less stressful.
TOG may never compete with industrial languages like C++ in performance. But it‚Äôs not trying to. It‚Äôs competing in joy, readability, and accessibility.
Future Directions
What could TOG become? A few visions:
Educational Language: Teach kids and beginners how to code without intimidation.
Playground Language: For artists, poets, or designers who want to experiment with code without the baggage of enterprise systems.
Specialized Tools: TOG can handle spreadsheets, toggles in UI, or even crypto ledgers with elegant simplicity.
TOG‚Äôs destiny is not to replace mainstream languages, but to inspire joy in code.
Conclusion
TOG is more than syntax. It‚Äôs a philosophy: programming should be snappy, human, and fun. Its toggles, arrays, and functions are minimal but expressive. Its conditionals read like thought. Its humor makes the process lighter.
In a world where programming languages are often weighed down by complexity, TOG reminds us: simplicity can be powerful, playfulness can be profound.
Whether it‚Äôs flipping a glowing cat toggle, tracking a crypto coin, or building a spreadsheet of friends‚Äô names, TOG shows us that programming can be as fun as it is functional.
And maybe that‚Äôs the greatest lesson: we don‚Äôt always need to program for machines. Sometimes, we program for ourselves ‚Äî for the joy of it.
