TOG_Ethos

In it's purest form TOG is about ON and OFF switches.
Most languages work in terms of True and False evaluation and ask too many questions.
In TOG you may ask a question, but if the quest is bad you will fail(probably).
Actually questions are good, about the furure and the past, if you questioun the present
you probably need a beer.

tOg5 requires a state of mind that is flow. Not flaw.
Music is key, to what lies beneath.
The Yeti would be proud, lol. OR not.

"The * is key to the multiplication of digits like all *'s should be.
but in wildcard form it should REGEX the shiz out of the keyboard.
but it cannot, it should not, it will NOT, therefore, {}."

toggle.max([1,2,3,4,5])
