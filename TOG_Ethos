TOG_Ethos

In it's purest form TOG is about ON and OFF switches.
Most languages work in terms of True and False evaluation and ask too many questions.
In TOG you may ask a question, but if the quest is bad you will fail(probably).
Actually questions are good, about the furure and the past, if you questioun the present
you probably need a beer.

Sincerely,
