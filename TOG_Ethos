Most languages work in terms of True and False evaluation and ask too many questions.
In TOG you may ask a question, but if the quest is bad you will fail(probably).

you probably need a beer.

tOg5 requires a state of mind that is flow. Not flaw.
Music is key, to what lies beneath.
The Yeti would be proud, lol. OR not.
